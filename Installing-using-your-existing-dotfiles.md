## 😬 Important notes
### During the installation
**where are going to be located your dotfiles?**
1. press `Enter` if you ok with the default location (`~/.dotfiles`)
2. if you want a custom location, the path should include the name of your new dotfiles folder (ex. `~/Documents/workspace/<folder_name>`), **you don't need to create it manually, if you do that, you'll get a .back folder of your empty folder**
